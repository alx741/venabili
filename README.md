![The Venabili keyboard](./artwork/logo_margin.png)

<p style="text-align:center;font-size:1.2em;margin-left:30px;">
A *mechanical*, *layered*, *programmable*, *ergonomic*, *hackable*
[keyboard](http://venabili.sillybytes.net).
</p>

## Why?

I wanted to build a keyboard from the ground up that would be exactly what I
wanted, no more and no less: Custom firmware, custom hardware design, custom
layout, custom everything.

## No, I mean why "Venabili"?

Oh, that! It's named after "Dors Venabili", a fictional character from Isaac
Asimov's "Foundation" series of novels.

## I want it!
