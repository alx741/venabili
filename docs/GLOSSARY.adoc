== Firmware

Software runs on the microcontroller in your keyboard


== Flashing

Writing the *firmware* in the microcontroller. This can happen at a *low level*,
requiring special hardware and connections directly to the microcontroller
board, and it's only needed the first time, when the microcontroller is brand
new. Or it can happen at a *user level*, that allows you to write a new version
of the firmware while your keyboard is connected through USB as usual.
