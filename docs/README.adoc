[.lead]
A _mechanical_, _layered_, _programmable_, _ergonomic_, _hackable_
http://venabili.sillybytes.net[keyboard].

Named after _Dors Venabili_, a fictional character from Isaac Asimov's
_Foundation_ Series of novels. Venabili is a 40% mechanical keyboard with
ergonomic keys layout.

Being a fully programmable keyboard, it gives you the ability to create layers
of functionality, declare multifunction keys that can operate as both modifiers
and normal keys, control the mouse, define macros, and more.


== How to Get One?

Venabili is not a commercial keyboard, you cannot buy neither a fully assembled
one nor a DIY kit. Instead, the project provides: hardware designs, circuitry
schematics, firmware, and very detailed instructions on how to build your own in
the link:building.adoc[Building Guide].

The whole project is released under FOSS and CC licences, so you can tweak every
aspect of it to adapt it to your needs and liking.
